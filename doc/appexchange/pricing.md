# Choosing your price model
### One-time license
This is a one time charge that clients will pay in order to gain access to your application.

### Subscription based model
This is a monthly recurring charge that clients will be required to pay once per calendar month.

### Free Applications
This is an application, free of charge. 

# In App Purchases
Any external elements that your application requires and is not free must be explicitly stated. If your application is free, it must provide some value to the platform, “as is”. If your application requires a subscription based payment, both the recurring payment date and amount must be visible and presented to the user.
